**README - CRUD GENERIC System / Municipality Garnishments** 


**Overview**<br>
This repository contains a comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application developed in Java 21 using Maven, and implemented in the NetBeans IDE. The application utilizes XAMPP with MySQL as the backend database, and Java Persistence API (JPA) for efficient data management.

**Purpose**<br>
The  CRUD System is specificallydesigned specifically for municipal authorities. The system allows users to create individuals, claims, view, update and delete records belonging to real people within the municipality.


**Features**<br>
1. Creation of Individuals
Users can input information for individuals into the system, including assigning them a unique Legajo (file number), specifying their role as a demanding, and providing details such as the amount of the demand and the date it was initiated.

**2. Database Storage**<br>
All entered individual records are securely stored in the backend MySQL database managed by XAMPP. This ensures data persistence and enables easy retrieval of information.

**3. Seamless Data Retrieval**<br>
The application allows users to directly access and view existing individual records stored in the database. Users can effortlessly retrieve details such as Legajo, demanding status, demand amount, and initiation date directly from within the program.

**Technologies Used**
>Java 21: The programming language used for the application.<br>
>Maven: Dependency management and build tool for the project.<br>
>NetBeans IDE: The integrated development environment used for coding and project management.<br>
>XAMPP with MySQL: The chosen database solution for secure and efficient data storage.<br>
>Java Persistence API (JPA): Used for managing the persistence of Java objects to relational databases.<br>

**Getting Started**<br>
To run the  CRUD System locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the project in NetBeans IDE.
Configure the database connection in the project settings, ensuring it matches your XAMPP MySQL setup.
Build and run the project.<br>
**Usage**
Once the project is up and running, you can use the user interface to perform CRUD operations on individual records. Add new individuals, view existing records, update information, and delete records as needed.
